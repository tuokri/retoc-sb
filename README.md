# retoc-sb

CLI tool for packing/unpacking Unreal Engine IoStore containers (.utoc/.ucas) as
well as converting between Zen assets and Legacy assets (found in .pak containers).

### Stellar Blade modding fork

Forked for usage in Stellar Blade modding. Contains additions from
[BlafKing's](https://github.com/BlafKing) retoc [fork](https://github.com/BlafKing/retoc),
plus a few additions of my own in order to expose a library interface
for use in other projects.

## compatibility

Unreal Engine versions 5.3+ are well supported and can convert entire games to
.pak and have them run without issue. Lack of dependency information in versions
prior to 5.3 may result in games failing to load a handful of assets, preventing
them from running from .pak, but should not be an issue for modding purposes.
